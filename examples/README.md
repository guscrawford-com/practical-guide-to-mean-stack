## shoe-catalog-api

*An under-the-hood look at how a REST API get's implemented in Node.js*

This example project comprises a microservice allowing access to a shoe catalog / inventory.

* ðŸ“‚ assets
  * ðŸ“‚ data *contains a .json file we load as a set of shoes that exist in the world (our domain model)*
  * ðŸ“‚ images *contains images of shoes in the .json*
* ðŸ“‚ **routes** *contains files named for all the **routes** we expose in our API*
  * ðŸ“„ inventory.js *maps HTTP verbs and paths to the **inventory-service***
  * ðŸ“„ shoes.js *maps HTTP verbs and paths to the **shoes-service***
* ðŸ“‚ **services** *contains files providing the **value** and **data** we expose in our API*
  * ðŸ“„ generic-repo-service.js *provides a base-class "repository" and elemental filtering system we can use to derrive more specific data-repos for*
  * ðŸ“„ inventory-service.js *provides inventory related **business-value***
  * ðŸ“„ shoes-service.js *provides **shoe** related data and value*
* ðŸ“‚ test *contains files for testing our API*
  * ðŸ“„ shoe-catalog-api.http *a script setup with details you need to test your API calls with the [VS Code Rest-Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)*
* ðŸ“„ index.js *an elaboration on `simple-server.js` extended to allow us to handle "routes", URL paths and query-strings in the `routes` folder* (application root)
* ðŸ“„ package.json *redundantly defines the root of this application; this project has no dependencies; start this project by running `node ./` from the root of the project*

## shoe-catalog-express

*Expanding on our ad-hoc implementation of a REST API, implementing in Node.js **with express***

This example project **still** comprises a microservice allowing access to a shoe catalog / inventory.

The project has been generated with **express-generator** by using the terminal command `express shoe-catalog-express`.

* ðŸ“‚ assets (cloned from [shoe-catalog-api](#shoe-catalog-api))
  * ðŸ“‚ data *contains a .json file we load as a set of shoes that exist in the world (our domain model)*
  * ðŸ“‚ images *contains images of shoes in the .json*
* ðŸ“‚ bin
  * ðŸ“„ www *though it lacks the 'js' extension; this is the entry JavaScript file that is exectuted by node when we run our server; it will subsequently `require` **app.js** below*
* ðŸ“‚ public *a folder that is typically configured so that it's contents are served "statically" (express streams the file contents by relative path lookup from the root of the request URL, mapped to this folder on requests that were not picked up by an earlier defined "route")*
  * ðŸ“‚ stylesheets *contains a .json file we load as a set of shoes that exist in the world (our domain model)*
    * ðŸ“„ styles.css *contains some fundamental styles used in **views***
* ðŸ“‚ **routes** *contains files named for all the **routes** we expose*
  * ðŸ“„ index.js *generated by express; this has been left to illustrate how express can be leveraged as an MVC framework to template HTML responses*
  * ðŸ“„ shoes.js *maps HTTP verbs and paths to the **shoes-service***
  * ðŸ“„ users.js *maps HTTP verbs and paths to a handler we can use to return user details*
* ðŸ“‚ **services** *contains files providing the **value** and **data** we expose in our API* (a clone of the **services** folder in the [shoe-catalog-api](#shoe-catalog-api) project)
  * ðŸ“„ generic-repo-service.js *provides a base-class "repository" and elemental filtering system we can use to derrive more specific data-repos for*
  * ðŸ“„ inventory-service.js *provides inventory related **business-value***
  * ðŸ“„ shoes-service.js *provides **shoe** related data and value*
* ðŸ“‚ views
  * ðŸ“„ error.jade *a **jade** file used to template the HTML response for errors thrown in express*
  * ðŸ“„ index.jade *a **jade** file used to template the HTML response for the **index.js** declared route handler above*
  * ðŸ“„ layout.jade *a **jade** file used by both above files to inherit a common partial layout structure*
* ðŸ“„ app.js *using this file to configure middleware and top-level routes*
* ðŸ“„ package.json *defines all the dependencies of this application; some internal task definitions like "start", etc.*

## simple-server

*Get your feet wet writing http servers.*

[simple-server.js](simple-server.js) illustrates the most fundamental *server-listener* and *request-listener* patterns.


```
function requestHandler (request, response) {
    /* process request; update response */
}

function serverListener (err) {
    /* bind a port and spawn streams with `requestHandler` */
}
```

*Install the [VS Code "REST Client"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to make the most of **test-simple-server.http***
